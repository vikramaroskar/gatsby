**Building** compiles your application with modern features like server-side rendering, route based code splitting ([and more!](/blog/2019-04-02-behind-the-scenes-what-makes-gatsby-great/)) for great performance out of the box.

During the build (when you run `gatsby build` or `gatsby develop`), data is fetched and combined into a GraphQL schema with a static snapshot of all data your site needs.
